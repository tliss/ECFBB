# ECFBB
ESOL Curriculum Framework Benchmark Browser

Hello! This program was created by Taylor A. Liss with help from Steve Seeley! It uses 
the Massachusetts Adult Basic Education Curriculum Framework for English Speakers of Other Languages 
found at:
    
http://www.doe.mass.edu/acls/frameworks/frameworks.html
    
Please Note: This program is not perfect. Due to software limitations, this program is unable to correctly 
show emphasis via underlining and italics as found in the original PDF document. This is most apparent in 
benchmarks like S2.4d and R3.4b. This should prove to be no major problem for most instructors that are 
familiar with the framework, but it is important to note nonetheless. 

Thank you for using my first program! I hope it proves useful for you in your lesson planning!

This program was created by Taylor A. Liss with help from Steve Seeley.
  
Note: Due to software limitations, this program is unable to correctly show emphasis via underlining and italics as found in the original PDF document. This is most apparent in benchmarks like S2.4d and R3.4b. This should prove to be no major problem for most instructors that are familiar with the framework, but it is important to note nonetheless.
